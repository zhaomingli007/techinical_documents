## Functional programming principle in scala

1. Imperative programming
	- Modify mutable variables
	- Use assignments
	- Using control structures such as loops, break, continue and return.
2. Imperative Programs and Computers
	- Scaling up issue: limited by "Von Neumann" bottleneck
		- Tends to conceptualize data structures word by *word*
